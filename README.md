# MusicDatabase

This is a basic component which can store, modify, export, and import song data. I made it as part of an extra credit project in my Software 2 class at OSU. It has an internal class called Song that can store the title, artist, length, and optionally the album of a song. The program can read from and write to tab delimited .txt files (which can be produced from excel or other programs) for cross platform transfer. It also has many method to add, remove, or get certain songs based on criteria as well, such as getting all songs from an album or by a certain artist.
